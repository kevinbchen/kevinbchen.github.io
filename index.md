  Hi! My name is Kevin. I am a software engineer; most recently I was at Meta, where I worked on optimizing machine learning inference for mobile AR / VR hardware (Quest 1 and 2, Portal, etc.).

  I made this website to document and share some of the personal [engineering projects]({% link projects.md %}) and [artwork]({% link art.md %}) that I've worked on. Thanks for visiting!
