QQ Manto is a simple PSP homebrew game inspired by Line Rider, where you draw lines for a blob to slide through. The name comes from "饅頭", or "steamed bun". 

The first version of the game was put together in a weekend for the [NEO Summer Coding Compo 2007](https://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php?topic=4628.0) (where it placed 10th in the PSP game category). At the time, I had been writing a verlet physics engine intended for a larger game; I was able to repurpose it for QQ Manto with a few tweaks.
