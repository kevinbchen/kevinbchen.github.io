This is an Android live wallpaper recreation of my favorite level from one of my favorite video games - the Outer Wall scene from [Cave Story](https://www.cavestory.org/) by Pixel. It features the Cave Story characters peacefully flying above clouds under a moonlit sky, with a nice parallax effect when you switch homescreens. 

{% include image_grid.html base_url="/projects/outerwallpaper/" images=page.images cols=4 %}

The wallpaper is also highly customizable:
- Characters (Skydragon/Kazuma/Quote or Balrog/Curly/Quote)
- Background theme (moonlit or foggy) and color
- Number of stars
- Wallpaper scale
- Animation speed
- Homescreen scrolling
- Frames per second

Customization options are available in the wallpaper's settings menu, which can be accessed through the included launcher or your live wallpaper chooser.
