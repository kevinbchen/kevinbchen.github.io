This is an Android live wallpaper recreation of my favorite level from one of my favorite video games - the Outer Wall scene from [Cave Story](https://www.cavestory.org/) by Pixel. It features the Cave Story characters peacefully flying above clouds under a moonlit sky, with a nice parallax effect when you switch homescreens.
